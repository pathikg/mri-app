<h2> About </h2>

&emsp; A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is a common test that lets doctors see inside your body. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues within the body. Since its invention, doctors and researchers continue to refine MRI techniques to assist in medical
procedures and research. However,The process of an MRI scan can be quite a hassle. From a doctor prescribing to take an MRI to going for the scan at the labs, then collecting reports from the lab and going to the doctor to show the results. The later steps can be done virtually to reduce the time and hassle for everyone. Also, image segmentation of an MRI is a critical task for patient’s disease management and it is difficult for the doctors to perform it. To overcome this difficulty there is a need to automate and standardize this task by using technology. So we are making a portal that will speed up the process between the patients, doctors and the labs. The website will allow the labs to share the reports with the patients and their respective doctors. Furthermore doctors can apply image segmentation algorithms on the report for further analysis and then send the prescription of the medicine along with insights/results from the analysis to the patients.
